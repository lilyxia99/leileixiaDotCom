Leilei Xia was born in Guangzhou, China. She is a multimedia artist who works in tactile art, experimental animation, video art, and participatory collective art. As one of the editors of the independent science zine Icosa Magazine and the founder of the tactile art collective Tactileye, Leilei explores how tactility and bodily feelings are manifested in different mediums, and is interested in combining the process and result of creating art, treating art not merely as a noun but as a verb.  
  
Her workshops have been hosted at the Institute of Contemporary Art at Virginia Commonwealth University, UCCA Center for Contemporary Art, The Guangzhou Academy of Fine Arts, and her films and animation have been awarded or selected in the Ann Arbor Film Festival, Stop Trik Animation Festival, Berlin Female Film Festival, Paris International Animation Festival, among others. Her works have been exhibited internationally in New York, Greensboro, Richmond, Guangzhou, and other cities. She was also one of the speakers at TEDxVCU 2023. She holds a BFA from Rhode Island School of Design and is currently pursuing an MFA at the Virginia Commonwealth University.
