Expect is a sci-fi speculative half documentary half fiction film shot in Virtual Reality (VR) that explores the hidden details behind how disabilities are represented in science fiction literature and media. The film features Chinese actors with disabilities role-playing as sci-fi characters in VR to rewrite, challenge and reimagine the conventional, ableist sci-fi tropes, such as the image of “super-crip” and the transhumanistic tendency to “fix” or eradicate disabilities through the myth of enhancement. As a film made in VR, Expect includes the process of the crew interacting with VR device, which on one hand enable actors to "carry out" things they can't achieve in reality, but on the other hand brought even more difficulties and barriers, ironically reflecting the nature of the failed promise of technology to an accessible future.  
The work situates itself in the context of Chinese ideological environment where eugenics, enhancement and development are taken for granted, and even people with disabilities might hold a very ableism mindset in this circumstance. While showcasing discussions around what is accessibilities of a cityscape and why those are important, the film explores how personal belief leads to different speculative futures, and why it is so difficult for an individual to imagine a future without ableism, even if they are people with disabilities themselves. It is a question of whether a person with disabilities can have as much respect and self-recognition even when they are not "super-crip", and the answer requires one to fundamentally challenge the Darwinistic logic in Neoliberalism.
