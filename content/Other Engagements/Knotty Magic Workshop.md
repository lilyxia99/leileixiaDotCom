**3 weeks online workshop collaborating with Ro Maiti and Icosa Magazine, zine collaboration illustrated by Matt Minchello, designed by Leilei Xia, 3-4/2023**  

This is a 3 week's "LARP + Learn" workshop aiming at individuals who are looking to strengthen their self-learning skills and tap into the art of community learning. Participants join the workshop as part of the magical world wizards or witches, and help each other learn knot theory and create projects with it, which involves mathematics, art, philosophy, live-action roleplayingâ€¦ In our Knotty Magic workshop, learning will be fun, communal, and self-driven. Everybody enter the space with something unique to teach and learn from each other.  
As the output, we weaved our imagination and research into a zine which not only is a catalog of all kinds of knowledge about knots, but also a documentation of our role-playing game process.

Below are the publications that were made at the end. It's a big map with both sides:
